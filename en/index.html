      <p>GeoGuessr is a game based on Google Street View, a service allowing to walk in the streets of the different
        countries of the world.
      </p>
      <p>The goal: finding in a fixed amount of time our position, as precisely as possible.</p>
      <p>Between a video game and a knowledge game, players use the different signs next to the road, landscapes or
        architecture to narrow down the place where they are.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bloc">
